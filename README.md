I've pioneered the creation of a pirate intelligent agent that leverages cutting-edge reinforcement learning concepts. 
This involved not just understanding the existing environment and structure, but also implementing the code that governs the agent's actions based on the environment.

I aimed to train the agent to pass through the environment and find treasure using neural networks and reinforcement learning algorithms. This involved writing custom logic for reward and punishment states of state-action pairs to guide the agent's go-through.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
The hypothetical system presented is designed to tackle real-world problems, a key focus for computer scientists. This is particularly relevant to those who train and build systems to emulate this kind of logic and problem-solving in different domains. The project applies the sub-field of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning to demonstrate how these types of solutions can be applied to real-world problems associated with autonomous navigation and choices in data-rich environments. This is worth noting because the article provides a practical use-case for AI that can be used to automate tasks, increase efficiencies, and make decisions in a data-driven world.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My solution as a computer scientist is to analyze the problem, decompose it into more minor issues, and handle it using the appropriate algorithms or techniques. In this project, I defined the first requirement as an agent that learns and divides the task into fundamental steps, such as building the environment, developing the reinforcement system, and training the agent. The approach was cycle-based, in which, after each iteration of reinforcement learning, the model was tested and tuned until the agent became more efficient.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibility is paramount in this project. I've ensured that the agent operates transparently, fairly, and without discrimination. The code and models being developed are not just efficient, but also safe and reliable for future use. I've made sure that the way AI makes decisions is understandable and the impact is predictable. User data is protected, the system is secure, and the tools developed do not pose any accidental harm to the end users or the organization.
